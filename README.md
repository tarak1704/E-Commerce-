# E-Commerce-
This project aims to build an AI-powered question-answering agent that interfaces with structured e-commerce datasets. The agent uses a locally hosted or free-access LLM to understand user queries, translate them into SQL, fetch data from a relational database, and respond in a clear, human-readable format.
